Honestly, hanggang ngayon natatawa pa rin ako kung paano tayo nag-meet. Sobrang unexpected, sobrang random, pero somehow nangyari. Hindi ko talaga inexpect na may magiging ganito ka-importante sa’kin, lalo na in such a short time. Ilang months pa lang tayong magkausap, pero I still want to get to know you more, 	yung totoong ikaw, lahat ng sides mo.

I know things between us are not exactly defined. We’re somewhere in between, and that’s okay. I don’t need a label to feel something real. I don’t need a title to appreciate you. I’m not here to push or pressure or make you feel like you have to give more than you’re ready to. That’s not love. That’s not care. And I care about you, deeply.

I really feel like you should know how much I appreciate you.

I guess this is just my own way of celebrating you the girl who’s quietly and unexpectedly become one of the best parts of my life.

You might not even realize how much you’ve affected me. But I do. Every single day.

There’s something soft and calming about you. Like, just being around you makes things feel a little lighter, a little safer. The world can be so loud and stressful sometimes, but when you’re around, everything feels a bit more okay.

And seriously, you’re so fun to be around. Like, you actually make me laugh not just because you’re funny, but because we get each other. I love our banter. I love how we can joke around and tease each other without it ever feeling awkward or forced. It’s like we’ve built this little world where we just click. We’re comfortable. It feels easy. And honestly, those moments when we’re just laughing and messing around? They’re some of my favorites.

What amazes me is how much we’ve experienced in such a short time, things I never imagined I’d do with someone. Sleep calls that turned into late-night talks, awkward silences, random laughter, and moments we still laugh about because they were so embarrassing but so us. Your voice during those calls became something I looked forward to—comforting, familiar, and honestly my favorite sound at the end of a long day.

We played games, watched movies, shared little moments that might seem simple to others, but meant so much to me. Those moments made ordinary days feel lighter. They reminded me that connection doesn’t always have to be grand—it can live in small laughs, shared screens, and quiet company.

I never expected any of this. I never expected you. But I’m really glad you came into my life, even if we don’t have any labels or clear direction.

I know we’re not calling each other anything. We’re not official or anything like that. And that’s fine. I’m not here to rush or pressure anything. I just want to be honest with you. And the truth is... you matter to me. Probably more than I show sometimes.

You’ve become someone really important to me.

You’re not mine. But somehow, you still feel like home. And I think that’s what this whole thing is really about.

These past months haven’t been perfect, Lagi tayong nag-aaway. Madalas kitang ma-disappoint, madalas din kitang masaktan. And I know ang hirap nun para sa’yo. Pero kahit ganun, nandiyan ka pa rin. You stayed. You chose to stay and you still want us to grow, kahit alam mong hindi ako perfect. Sobrang na-aappreciate ko yun, kahit minsan hindi ko masabi ng maayos.

I just want to say thank you. For being who you are. For being soft and kind and thoughtful. For making me laugh, for showing up, even in small ways. For every little moment that probably didn’t seem like a big deal to you, but meant a lot to me.

And I want you to know that I admire how you carry yourself, even when you’re hurting. I admire how you still smile, even when you’re unsure. I admire how you open up, piece by piece, even when it scares you. I see all of it. And I appreciate it all.

I know I’m not easy to deal with. I know I still have a lot to learn, a lot to fix, and a lot to grow into. But I want you to know that I see your effort. I see your patience. I see your willingness to grow with me instead of walking away when things get hard. And that’s something I’m incredibly grateful for.

Hindi ko sinasabi na perfect ako or bigla akong magbabago overnight. Pero sincere ako when I say na gusto kong mag-grow—as a person, and sana, with you. Ayokong balewalain lahat ng pinagdaanan natin, lahat ng moments, lahat ng effort mo.

Also, I just hope you know na mahalaga ka sa’kin. Kahit magulo, kahit hindi perfect, kahit may lapses
		
This Christmas, I just want to say thank you for staying, for trying, for believing in us even when it’s messy. Thank you for being you. I don’t know exactly where life will take us, but I do know that meeting you was one of the unexpected gifts I didn’t know I needed.

Merry Christmas.
And thank you for being part of my year, my days, and my heart, even in ways I’m still learning how to express.

Nervous energy (Party on you, party on you, party on)
My heart rate rises higher, higher up (Party on you, party on you, party on)
I wish you'd get here, kiss my face (Party on you, party on you, party on)

It's the anticipation when the amps turn on
Just cables and crackle
It's the first flicker of the neon sign
It's the words stuck in your Adam's apple

It's a hand on the handle of the front door
It's making eyes in the middle of the dance floor
I feel like hot shit, wanna make out
In your car in the lot of a drug store
It's a bumblebee on a blossom
The first coffee shop run in Autumn
It's that feeling, a propeller
The first line of a fucking bestseller

The song's about to start (Can you hear it?)
The door's about to open (Can you feel it?)
The flower's about to fruit (Can you see it?)
I'm about to fall for you

About to fall for you

It's the accidental touch when you don't mean to
The thickest tension
It's the millisecond freeze frame after good news
Or an unexpected mention

It's the big long bow before the show ends
The phone toss when it's risky and you hit send
It's feeling dizzy when you're tipsy
Wondering why you're so nervous 'round a so-called "friend"
It's goosebumps when you hear the drums
The running start before the big jump
It's that feeling, so stellar
Bro, if you like her, just go and fucking tell her

Party on you, party on you, party on
Party on you, party on you, party on
Party on you, party on you, party on

It's the anticipation when the amps turn on
Just cables and crackle
It's the first flicker of the neon sign
It's the words stuck in your Adam's apple

It's a hand on the handle of the front door
It's making eyes in the middle of the dance floor
I feel like hot shit, wanna make out
In your car in the lot of a drug store
It's a bumblebee on a blossom
The first coffee shop run in Autumn
It's that feeling, a propeller
The first line of a fucking bestseller

The song's about to start (Can you hear it?)
The door's about to open (Can you feel it?)
The flower's about to fruit (Can you see it?)
I'm about to fall for you

About to fall for you

It's the accidental touch when you don't mean to
The thickest tension
It's the millisecond freeze frame after good news
Or an unexpected mention

It's the big long bow before the show ends
The phone toss when it's risky and you hit send
It's feeling dizzy when you're tipsy
Wondering why you're so nervous 'round a so-called "friend"
It's goosebumps when you hear the drums
The running start before the big jump
It's that feeling, so stellar
Bro, if you like her, just go and fucking tell her

The song's about to start (Can you hear it?)
The door's about to open (Can you feel it?)
The flower's about to fruit (Can you see it?)
I'm about to fall for you
The song's about to start (Can you hear it?)
The door's about to open (Can you feel it?)
The flower's about to fruit (Can you see it?)
I'm about to fall for you

About to fall for you
About to fall for you
